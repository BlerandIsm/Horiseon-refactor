# Refactoring the existing code in accordance to the guidelines

In this project I was given a broken code that needed to be refactored in order to build a fully functional website for our client. 
The code was missing signficant structural pieces starting with the search bar where the hyperlinks were not working. 
HTML sematics needed retouching
CSS code needed formating and cleaning making it accesible for the other users and simplifying while saving the websites main fundamentals

- Header section
What I noticed upon opening the code was the repetition of "div" element which helps create a "containing box" for the following code but is not a great element because it doesnt not clear up what the section is and what part of the coding are we working on. So I decided to create unique elements for each section.

This make it easy for me to refactor the CSS styling sheet because now I had specific elements, classes and ID to work on
